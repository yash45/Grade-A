<h1 style="font-size: 50px">Top 10 Greatest Scientists Who Changed The World</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(5, 29, 29)">Right from the beginning of human settlement, a lot of people came up with ideas, philosophies, 
   beliefs, experiments, research, redesigning of thoughts, and surveys to bring myths to reality.
   <br>People contributed for science to study different aspects of nature to prosper mankind. 
   These genius minds put a keen interest on every phenomenon right from when they were kids.</p>
   The zeal, passion, dedication, hard work and the effort they put in their work helped them discover 
   something new about the world we live in.</p>
<p title="He died 'along' time ago">The world today dwells in the abode of scientific advancement in different
     sectors of medical science, engineering and technology because of these 
     scientists. <p class="cool">The present picture of the world that we see would not have 
     transformed without the contribution of these great personalities. 
     Great philosophers and masterminds that existed in the ancient Greek era to

    widely used in machines as well as in constructions</q>.<blockquote>Born on 287 BC, Archimedes is one of the 
    finest scientist who broke through in both theories and practice.</blockquote></p3>
<p3>He also discovered the laws of lever, density, fluid equilibrium, buoyancy in
